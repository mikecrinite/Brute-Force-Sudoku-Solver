A Sudoku Solver that uses a brute force/backtracking approach

This Sudoku Solver reads a file from the command line and stores it as a 2D Array
It checks each cell sequentially, and if empty, it attempts to fill the cell. It makes
a recusive call in order to try the next empty cell, and backtracks if that call does
not lead to a solution.
